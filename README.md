# RAG Playground Environment
Welcome to the RAG Playground Environment! This guide will help you quickly set up and explore the components of your environment. **Let's dive in! üöÄ**

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following:

1. **Docker**: Install Docker from [https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).
2. **Docker Compose**: Included with Docker Desktop. Verify installation with:
   ```bash
   docker-compose --version
   ```
3. **Git**: Install Git from [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/).

## Getting StartedÔ∏è

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oscxrojas/rag_environment.git
   cd rag_environment
   ```

2. **Set Environment Variables**:
   - Use the `.env-template` file to create your own.
   - Obtain your OpenAI API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/).

3. **Bootstrap the Environment**:
   Run the bootstrap script to provision the environment:
   ```bash
   ./bootstrap.sh
   ```

   ### What Happens During Bootstrap:
   - Docker removes orphaned containers and builds the images.
   - Containers for **Ollama**, **Qdrant**, **Postgres**, **clickhouse**, **minio**, **redis**, **langfuse-worker**, **langfuse-web** and **jupyter** start sequentially.
   - The Ollama model specified in `.env` is downloaded. If the model already exists, the download is skipped.

> [!TIP]
> **Confirm Services Are Running**<br>
> After the bootstrap completes, verify that all containers are running using: 
> ```bash
>   docker ps
>   ```
> You should see something like this
> ```
> CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                          COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                              NAMES

> ```

## Customizing Ollama Models

- Available models for Ollama can be found [here](https://ollama.ai/models).
- To change the model:
  1. Update the `OLLAMA_MODEL` variable in `.env`.
  2. Re-run the bootstrap script to download the new model.

## You're All Set! üéâ

Now that your environment is up and running, feel free to explore its capabilities!
Services URL

- [Jupyter](http://localhost:8888/)
- [Langfuse](http://localhost:3000/)
- [Qdrant](http://localhost:6333/dashboard)
- [Ollama](http://localhost:11434/)

## Docker Compose Tips üê≥

1. **Access a Container**:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it <container-name> bash
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     docker exec -it langfuse bash
     ```

2. **Run a Command in a Container**:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec <service-name> <command>
     ```
     Example:
     ```bash
     docker-compose exec ollama printenv
     ```

3. **Stop All Containers**:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down
     ```

4. **Remove Orphaned Containers**:
     ```bash
     docker-compose down --remove-orphans
     ```

5. **Check Logs for a Service**:
     ```bash
     docker-compose logs <service-name>
     ```
   
6. **Restart a specific service**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart <service_name>
   ```

## Troubleshooting & Support üí°

- If you encounter issues, check the logs for specific services.
- Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured.
- Refer to [Docker Docs](https://docs.docker.com/) for advanced troubleshooting.
